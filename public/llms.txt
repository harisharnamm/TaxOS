# TaxOS - AI Operating System for Tax Professionals

TaxOS is the first AI-powered operating system designed specifically for tax professionals and CPAs. It helps accountants save client work, preview changes, and restore files instantly when AI tools or software glitches cause problems.

## What is TaxOS?

TaxOS is AI file protection for tax season. It snapshots your client files before AI breaks them, letting you instantly save, preview, and restore your work with one click. Unlike manual backups, which are slow and cluttered, TaxOS captures real-time changes, AI mistakes, and accidental deletions without cluttering your folders.

## Key Features

- **Save**: Instantly save client files and undo bad AI edits anytime
- **Preview**: Switch to any past version of client work in one click  
- **Restore**: Go back to a clean client file in one click
- **AI Client File Search**: Ask anything about your client history across tax years, returns, and amendments
- **Tax Software Compatibility**: Works with Drake, Lacerte, ProSeries, TaxWise, UltraTax CS, and more
- **Secure Local Storage**: Client files never leave your machine - full HIPAA and SOX compliance
- **Tax Year Organization**: Each tax year has its own backup timeline

## Why Not Just Manual Backups?

- **Manual backups take forever** → TaxOS captures changes instantly
- **Manual backups clutter folders with copies** → TaxOS saves separately, keeps folders organized  
- **Manual backups are built for IT departments** → TaxOS works for tax professionals and bookkeepers
- **Manual backups are for finished work** → TaxOS is for tax season - fast, chaotic, and deadline-driven
